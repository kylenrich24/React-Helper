ðŸŒ€ &nbsp; React is a javascript library <br>
ðŸŒ€ &nbsp; React's ultimate purpose is to show content(HTML) to users and handle user interaction (takes care of the V in MVC) <br>

## React Key Concepts
<br>
### The Birth of React
- JQuery - allows for manipulation of DOM through Javascript
- Traditonally, we used to have HTML after HTML for every single page in an application <br>
#### SPA
- we now focus more on Javascript and less on HTML (data > page)
- instead of making a request and getting a new HTML document, we stay on one HTML/DOM and focus on Javascript updates. We can render new things without even communicating with the server anymore.

### Key Concepts
ðŸŒ€ &nbsp; Don't touch the DOM <br>

## Component
<br>
ðŸŒ€ &nbsp; Used to create HTML, have it show up in the screen and react to user's inputs
ðŸŒ€ &nbsp; We create HTML via JSX, JSX determines the content of our React App
